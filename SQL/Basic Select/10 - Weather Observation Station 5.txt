Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

STATION
	
Field             Type
ID                Number
City              Varchar2(21)
State	          Varchar2(3)
LAT_N	          Number
LONG_W   	      Number

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Sample Input

Let's say that CITY only has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY

Sample Output

ABC 3
PQRS 4
Explanation

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with the respective lengths  and . The longest-named city is obviously PQRS, but there are  options for shortest-named city; we choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

Note 
You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.

Query :-

select * from (SELECT CITY, length(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY length(CITY), city) where rownum=1
union all
select * from (select city, length(city) from station order by length(city) desc, city) where rownum=1;
